# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version - 3.0.4

* Rails version - 7.0.4

* To launch application you have to execute command rails s (default port is localhost:3000). You can change test input parameters on LabExperimentsProject/app/controllers/laboratory_experiments_controller.rb -> create_params on line :15. once parameters are typed in correctly, you can open localhost:3000 or 127.0.0.1:3000 in your browser and generated output will be displayed there.
